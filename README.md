MINI PROJECT

SSB: Smart Speed Breaker is a project aimed to reduce accidents by speeding vehicles without affecting emergency vehicles. SSB is designed in such a way that it will only affect vehicles traveling above the speed limit. Speeding vehicles activate the SSB which rises the speed hump and it gives the driver of the speeding vehicle a physical remainder to slow down. It won't affect vehicles traveling within the speed limit and the system will be trained to distinguish emergency vehicles and allow them to pass with ease even at high speed. SSB will help to provide smooth ride for ambulances and helps them to reach the destination on time because of the reduced stopping time at SSB. The are allowed to travel at max speed without interference.

Here we used ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance and there by calculate the speed. This calculated speed was compared with preset values provided as default. When the speed is above the limit, speed breaker is activated with proper notification to avoid any possible accident. If the image recoginising part detects emergency vehicles SSB is not activated and speed comparison won't even take place. As a begining we implemented speed detection and signaling on a small controlled model.
